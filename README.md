# Head_Pose_Estimation-DeepLearning

# Instructions

Upload the modified_data.zip into your Jupiter environment, like sagemaker from AWS that provides Jupiter notebook. 

Now upload the tilt.ipynb and pan.ipynb into the Jupiter notebook. Open the file and make sure its running on "conda_tensorflow2_p36" since we need tensor flow version to be higher than 2.0 for our model to run. 

Now go to kernel drop down menu option and click on Restart & Run All.
